The code repository for AIA Life Hack 2018 #AIALIFEHACK18

# Storyline

I am a AIA customer for more than 10 years. When my mother got stroke 2 years ago, I evaluated her medical history, and found out that she didn't buy any insurance product.

## Problem Statement

In AIA Life Hack 2018, we would like raise awareness of family protection. 

## Proposed Solution

We would like to use **Gamification** approach to improve **customer engagement** from personal level to family level. 

## Potential Benefits

The potential benefits are:
- **Bring** healthier life to the customers and their core family members
- **Reach** out more potential customers
