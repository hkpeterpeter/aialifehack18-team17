The code repository for AIA Life Hack 2018 #AIALIFEHACK18

# Storyline

I am a AIA customer for more than 10 years. When my mother got stroke 2 years ago, I evaluated her medical history, and found out that she didn't buy any insurance product.

# Problem Statement

In AIA Life Hack 2018, we would like raise awareness of family protection. 

# Proposed Solution

We would like to use **Gamification** approach to improve **customer engagement** from personal level to family level. 

# Potential Benefits

The potential benefits are:
- **Bring** healthier life to the customers and their core family members
- **Reach** out more potential customers

# Discussion on Friday night

## Key points we discussed

We aim to improve AIA Vitality ecosystem in the following 2 main directions

- Family-based Data Analysis and Visualization
    - One family member encouages/extends to other family members
    - Idea: Family games to engage more family members (e.g. father/mother/kids)
    - Incentives
        - Free wearable devices for family
        - Free body checks for family
- New Data Points Collection via Wearable Devices
    - Possible data points
        - Food/drink habit
        - Personalized sleep pattern
        - Mobile phone screen usage
        - Nutrition intakes everyday
    - Vitality records "number of steps" to evaluate how healthy a person is 
    - Modern wearable devices (e.g. Apple Watch / FitBit) can record more data from users

## Goals
- Strengthen family bond
- Reach out more potential customers
- In the long term, reach the goal of Usage-Based Insurance (UBI)
