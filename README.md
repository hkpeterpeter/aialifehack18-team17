# Discussion on Friday night

## Key points we discussed

We aim to improve AIA Vitality ecosystem in the following 2 main directions

- Family-based Data Analysis and Visualization
    - One family member encouages/extends to other family members
    - Idea: Family games to engage more family members (e.g. father/mother/kids)
    - Incentives
        - Free wearable devices for family
        - Free body checks for family
- New Data Points Collection via Wearable Devices
    - Possible data points
        - Food/drink habit
        - Personalized sleep pattern
        - Mobile phone screen usage
        - Nutrition intakes everyday
    - Vitality records "number of steps" to evaluate how healthy a person is 
    - Modern wearable devices (e.g. Apple Watch / FitBit) can record more data from users

## Long-term Goals
- Usage-Based Insurance (UBI)
- Reduce the abuse of medical insurance reimbursement
