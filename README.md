# Discussion on Friday night

## Key points we discussed

We aim to improve AIA Vitality ecosystem in the following 2 main directions

- Family-based Data Analysis and Visualization
    - Vitality is mainly focused on improving personal health
    - We would like to enhance it by introducing a family-based concept
- Explore New Datasets from Wearable Devices
    - Vitality records "number of steps" to evaluate how healthy a person is 
    - Modern wearable devices (e.g. Apple Watch / FitBit) can record more data from users

## Long-term Goals
- Usage-Based Insurance (UBI)
